# What is the use of react redux 
Redux is a predictable state container designed to manage the state of an application in a consistent manner between different components and across component updates. React Redux provides mechanisms to manage and update the state of a React application through global state, as well as a way to inject state into React components via properties.

## Here are some of the primary uses and benefits of React Redux:
1. State Management:
Centralized Store: Redux creates a centralized data store for the entire application, helping you manage the state globally and consistently.
2. Predictable State with Immutable Updates:
Immutable State: The state in Redux is immutable, meaning it does not change directly. Instead, every update creates a new state object.
Predictable State: The strict architecture and the immutability of the state lead to more predictable behavior of the application.
3. Debugging:
Debugging Capabilities: The predictable state and strict update patterns make it easier to debug the application.


# Below are the high-level steps to set up a basic React application with Redux using `react-redux`:

### Step 1: Set Up Your React App
- Create a new React application using Create React App or your preferred setup.
  
### Step 2: Install Redux and React-Redux
- Install the necessary packages:
  ```bash
  npm install redux react-redux
  ```
  
### Step 3: Define Redux State, Actions, and Reducer
- **Define the initial state** and **actions** of your application.
- **Create a reducer** that takes the current state and an action, and returns the new state.

### Step 4: Create Redux Store
- **Create a Redux store** using `createStore(reducer)` where `reducer` is the function created in step 3.
  
### Step 5: Wrap the App with `Provider`
- Wrap your root React component with `react-redux`'s `Provider` component, and pass your Redux store to it as a prop.

### Step 6: Use Redux State in Components
- Use `useSelector` to select data from your Redux store.
- Example: 
  ```jsx
  const myData = useSelector(state => state.myData);
  ```
  
### Step 7: Dispatch Actions in Components
- Use `useDispatch` to dispatch actions to the Redux store.
- Example: 
  ```jsx
  const dispatch = useDispatch();
  dispatch(myAction());
  ```
  
### Step 8: Connect Components to React
- Make sure your components consume and/or modify the Redux state through `useSelector` and `useDispatch`.

### Additional Notes:
- For managing asynchronous logic or side effects, consider adding middleware like `redux-thunk` or `redux-saga` to your Redux store.
- For handling complex state selection logic, consider using `reselect` to create memoized selector functions.

### Example Directory Structure:

Here's a basic example of how you might organize your Redux logic:

```
src/
  ├── actions/
  │    ├── index.js   # Define and export your action creators here
  │   
  ├── reducers/
  │    ├── index.js   # Combine your reducers and export the root reducer here
  │   
  ├── store.js        # Create and export your Redux store here
  ├── App.js          # Use `Provider` to make the store available to all components
  └── index.js        # Render the main app
```

### Quick Sample:

- **actions/index.js**:
  ```javascript
  export const increment = () => ({ type: 'INCREMENT' });
  ```
  
- **reducers/index.js**:
  ```javascript
  export default function counterReducer(state = 0, action) {
    switch (action.type) {
      case 'INCREMENT':
        return state + 1;
      default:
        return state;
    }
  }
  ```
  
- **store.js**:
  ```javascript
  import { createStore } from 'redux';
  import rootReducer from './reducers';
  export default createStore(rootReducer);
  ```
  
- **App.js**:
  ```jsx
  import React from 'react';
  import { useSelector, useDispatch } from 'react-redux';
  import { increment } from './actions';
  
  function App() {
    const count = useSelector(state => state);
    const dispatch = useDispatch();
  
    return (
      <div>
        <p>Count: {count}</p>
        <button onClick={() => dispatch(increment())}>Increment</button>
      </div>
    );
  }
  
  export default App;
  ```
  
- **index.js**:
  ```jsx
  import React from 'react';
  import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
  import { Provider } from 'react-redux';
  import store from './store';
  import App from './App';

  ReactDOM.render(
    <Provider store={store}>
      <App />
    </Provider>,
    document.getElementById('root')
  );
  ```
