# React Learning Repository

Welcome to the React Learning repository! This repository contains the code samples that I have created while learning React. The code samples cover a wide range of topics from the basics of React to more advanced concepts like Redux, Hooks, and React Router.
## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, simply clone or download the repository to your local machine. You will need Node.js and npm installed on your machine to run the code samples. Once you have the repository on your machine, navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run the following command:
```
npm install
```
This will install all the necessary dependencies required to run the code samples.
## Code Samples

The code samples in this repository are organized by topic. Each topic has its own folder with one or more code samples. Here's an overview of the topics covered in this repository:

    Basics: This folder contains code samples that cover the basics of React like components, props, and state.

    Forms: This folder contains code samples that cover form handling in React.

    Routing: This folder contains code samples that cover routing in React using React Router.

    Redux: This folder contains code samples that cover state management in React using Redux.

    Hooks: This folder contains code samples that cover the use of React Hooks.

### Contributing

If you find a bug in any of the code samples or have a suggestion for improvement, please feel free to submit an issue or pull request. I'm always happy to hear from others who are learning React, and I'm open to collaboration.
